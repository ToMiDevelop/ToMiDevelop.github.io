# Who is ToMiDevelop?

## 1. Mathematician

First of all I'm a master of maths, this implicates my way of thinking, interacting with the world, looking at daily problems and ways to solve 'em. Mathematics is one the most important parts of me beeing... me! My formal eduaction gave me also a clear perspective at solving problems and creating algorithms with formal logic in the backend - this makes a fundament of my programming activities.

## 2. Programmer

I started to code when I Was looking for good software tools, which could help me in my research work - and found R! Then my journey in exploring programming has started. On my way I discovered .NET and C#, Python and... MicroPython for my hobby DIY projects. Now I'm a .NET programmer in my professional life and a big enthusiast of MicroPython on microcontrollers serving the logic and control over my DIY projects.
